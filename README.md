# Unity Natural MCP Extension Tools

Custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that extend [Unity Natural MCP](https://github.com/notargs/UnityNaturalMCP) server capabilities for comprehensive Unity Editor automation.

## Overview

This package provides a collection of custom MCP tools designed to enhance the Unity Natural MCP server with additional Unity Editor operation capabilities. It extends the base functionality provided by Unity Natural MCP to enable more comprehensive automation workflows.

## Base Project

This is an extension of [Unity Natural MCP](https://github.com/notargs/UnityNaturalMCP) by notargs, which provides MCP server integration for Unity Editor.

## Features

### 🎯 Scene Object Management
- Create empty GameObjects and primitives
- Duplicate and delete objects
- Set parent-child relationships
- Transform property manipulation

### 🎨 Material Operations
- Create materials with custom shaders
- Set material properties (color, metallic, smoothness, emission)
- Assign materials to renderers
- List and filter materials

### 🔧 Component Properties
- Configure renderer properties
- Set up colliders (Box, Sphere, Capsule)
- Configure audio sources
- Add components dynamically

### ✨ Particle Systems
- Create particle systems
- Configure main module properties
- Set up emission and shape modules
- Control playback

### 📦 Asset Management
- Create folders
- Convert GameObjects to prefabs
- Instantiate prefabs
- List and delete assets

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Unity Natural MCP](https://github.com/notargs/UnityNaturalMCP) installed and configured
2. Add this package to your Unity project via Package Manager
3. The tools will be automatically registered when the MCP server starts
